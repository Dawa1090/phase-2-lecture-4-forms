# Phase 2, Lecture 4: Forms

## Lecture Topics

- Controlled vs. Uncontrolled inputs

## Introduction

Today we'll continue to build our app for the pet adoption center, Flatapets, that displays a list of pets available for adoption at this pet adoption center. We will be adding a feature to this app that will allow the user to submit a form to add a new pet that will be available for adoption. Once the user clicks the "Add Pet" submit button, a new pet should be added to the list of pets that are displayed on the page. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out this new feature in this app.
